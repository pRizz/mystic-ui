# Mystic UI

Components that fill the gap of *cool and beautiful components* in the **SolidJS** ecosystem. Crafted with care using **TailwindCSS**, **PandaCSS** and **Motion One**.

## GitHub Package Support

The repo root can now be installed directly from GitHub as a source-only package for **Vite/Solid** consumers.

```bash
npm install github:pRizz/mystic-ui
```

Supported imports in this compatibility pass:

```ts
import { WordRotate } from "mystic-ui";
import { WordRotate as TailwindWordRotate } from "mystic-ui/tailwind";
```

Current boundary for GitHub dependency usage:

- Only the **Tailwind** component surface is exported from the root package.
- This package contract is intended for **Vite** projects using **SolidJS** / `vite-plugin-solid`.
- **Panda** components are not exported yet because they depend on generated `styled-system` files that are not shipped in the root package contract.

## Features

- **Compatible with both Tailwind and Panda** - Use with the css framework of your choice!
- **Copy+Paste Components** - As simple as it sounds.
- **CLI Support** - Add Mystic components to your projects even faster.
- **TypeScript** - Get all the intellisense you want.

## GitHub Dependency Notes

- The root package exports `mystic-ui` and `mystic-ui/tailwind`.
- Deep imports into workspace packages such as `@mystic-ui/tailwind` are not part of the GitHub install contract.
- The GitHub package is source-only on purpose; no `dist` output is committed for this compatibility pass.

## Why?

I think by now we all know how important a good UI is for websites and applications. It's the first thing users see and it's the first thing they interact with, so it's important to get it right.

Inspite of that, I would rather focus on buiding the *heart* of the software, I guess that's why component libraries such as [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) and [Park UI](https://park-ui.com/) are so popular, they allow developers to focus on the core of their software while resting assured in the fact that users will have a good first impression.

That's why I made **Mystic UI**, because currently there is no collection of *cool and beautiful components* for the SolidJS ecosystem, and I think it's important to have one.

## PRs Welcome

If you want to see a component here, open an issue or create a PR. Sometimes it gets tough with just a single guy maintaining a huge project, so any help is appreciated.
